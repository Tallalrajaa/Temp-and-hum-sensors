RASPBERRY PI
TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR DHT22
LCD 1602
JUMPER WIRES
BREADBOARD
10K RESISTER
DHT22 got 4 pins
Pin 1 is VCC (Power Supply)
Pin 2 is DATA (The data signal)
Pin 3 is NULL (Do not connect)
Pin 4 is GND (Ground)
Place a 10k resistor between Pin 1 and Pin 2 of the DHT22
Wire Pin 1 of the DHT22 to Physical Pin 1 (3v3) on the Pi
Wire Pin 2 of the DHT22 to Physical Pin 7 (GPIO4) on the Pi
Wire Pin 4 of the DHT22 to Physical Pin 6 (GND) on the Pi
Furthermore, using breadboard will make it convenient for wiring the components using jumper wires (male-to-female). 
Additionally you can make a machine which can also give you other measurement including temperature and humidity value 
for example pressure, oxygen level etc you just need different sensors including pressure sensor, etc and their library which can be find from google.
